# CfgSwitcher
## v2.0.0
### Description
This is the first formal release of the CfgSwitcher application, the goal of which is to enable automatic switching of application (specifically game) configuration files based upon whether a laptop is on battery or wall power. 

Most laptops will reduce their performance and graphical power while unplugged, necessitating having to change game settings manually depending on a user's power situation.

With CfgSwitcher, a user can now grab the settings files of their games during both the plugged-in and unplugged states, and have them applied automatically when their power state changes.
